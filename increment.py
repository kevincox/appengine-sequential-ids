class Increment(object):
	"""
		A class for getting sequences of "eventually sequential" integers on
		Google App Engine.  It uses shading counters reserving chunks of ids
		from a master counter.

		The idea is to get sequential ids. However, to make it scale, atomic
		sequential ids can't be used.  Instead ids are reserved from a master
		in chunks and then served out.  This ensures that you are getting
		"almost" sequential ids, and that all the ids will be used eventually.

		The main design goals of this library were scalability and gap-free ids.
		This means that performance should scale horizontally with the chunk
		size (provided you have enough shards that they aren't overloaded).

		Gap-free means that no ids will be missed.  However it is important to
		note that there is no (easy) way to return ids to the counter. Once you
		ask for them they are yours (unless it is inside a transaction and you
		cancel it). In theory you could manually create a shard with the `cur`
		and `max` values covering the ids you want. You can freeze your counters
		and modify the values of an empty shard (``cur >= max``) or modify the
		values of a shard adjacent to the values you wish to return.  If you
		want to return values while live you can create a new shard with the
		proper values and update your app to use that shard.

		Adding and removing shards
		==========================
		All you have to do to add a shard is raise the `shards` parameter in the
		constructor.  The shard is automatically created the first time it is
		accessed.

		.. note::
			If you add a large number of shards in proportion to your current
			number you may get some contention on the master as they fetch their
			first chunk of ids.  If you are going to double your number of
			shards, for example, you will have half of your request hitting the
			master for a short while.  If you need to make a dramatic change
			to the number of shards consider doing it in smaller steps.

		To remove a shard you can just decrement the count but you will loose
		the values in that shard.  For how to return those values see above.

		Transactions
		============
		The shards use transactions to update atomically.  If you are in a
		trasaction it will join it and if you are not it will create one.  Each
		call will make at least one group access and possibly access the root
		node (making it two groups). Therefore if you are calling this inside of
		a transaction you will need to do a cross-group transaction.

			Constructor.

			This creates an Incrementor.  It also controls some settings.  It
			is fairly cheep to set up but you may wish to cache it somewhere
			so that you don't have to provide the `name`, `chunk` and `shards`
			values all over your code.

			Args:
				name (str):
					A name for this counter.  It can be anything as long as it
					doesn't contain a double underscore "__".  If a counter for
					this name doesn't exist it is created, if it already exists
					it will be used.

			Kwargs:
				chunk (int):
					The chunk fetch size.  This is local to the python object,
					this means that if a call to this instance requires a fetch
					from master the shard will reserve this many extra ids.

					There is no speed downside to setting this larger, it just
					means that your ids may be further apart when created.  This
					value is what controls the load on the master.  If you have
					contention on the master this should be raised.
					
					This defaults to zero so that ``Increment("name").delete()``
					works.  If you have a chunk size of zero it will effectively
					disabling batch fetching, defeating the purpose of the
					counters (expect that it becomes easy to scale later).
				shards (int):
					The number of shards to use.  By default it is related to
					the value of `chunk`.  Currently it is `chunk` plus the log
					of `chunk` to the base 2.  In a perfect world it could be
					equal to the chunk size but if a number of shards run out
					of ids at the same time they will all go to the master.  If
					there is contention on the shards this value should be
					raised.

					If this value is ``0`` the root node will be accessed
					directly each time.  This may be used for small loads so
					that you can scale later as you need to.  Note that setting
					this to ``1`` is just a waste of resources.
				min (int):
					The lowest id to serve.  This only has effect when creating
					the counter.  If "connecting" to an existing counter it is
					ignored. This defaults to one because that is the lowest
					key id appengine supports.
				max (int):
					The highest id to serve.  This defaults to the largest
					possible signed 64-bit integer.  This only has effect when
					creating the counter.  If "connecting" to an existing
					counter it is ignored.
				direct (bool):
					If set, request for more ids then the chunk size are passed
					directly to the master rather then being passed through a
					slave.  It is recommended to leave this set as you will hit
					one entity rather than two.  If unset `reserve()` has a
					lower chance of returning enough ids for large request.
					That being said you should rarely be making request larger
					then the chunk size as it defeats the purpose of the
					sharding.
